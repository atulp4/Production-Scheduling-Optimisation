# Production-Scheduling-Optimisation-and-Automation

The project was an intensive and gruesome undertaking during my first year in the field of Data Science. The project revolved around automating 
the manual Cleaning In Place scheduling of a manufacturing plant in Reiti, Italy. Closely working with business heads at the plant, helped 
understand the task at hand. In simple words, there were 50+ manufacturing machines in the plant, that were connected to 4 cleaning machines 
through pipes. The manufacturing machines had pre-planned production scedules according to which their cleaning schedules had to be 
scheduled. There were different constraints at hand that had to be considered. To successfully do this, a model was developed that could 
generate schedules for all pre-planned production activities. A front-end was also developed and deployed that helped the Head Scheduler
of the plant generate schedules and monitor KPI's.
